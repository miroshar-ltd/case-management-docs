# Progress the workflow

---

The case workflow is accessed by clicking on the steps icon with the case open. The workflow is designed to guide the case manager through the steps of the case, ensuring consistent case treatment and compliance with the processes and procedure of a particular case type. The workflow ensures that the clients of similar case types are managed in the same way, receive the same documents and have a uniform experience throughout the life of their case. The screen is known as the workflow steps progression screen.

1. The screen is split into three panels. The workflow steps progression, quick view action and the questions/fields/forms view panel.
2. In the left panel the steps of the workflow are numbered to arrange the order of the steps. Each step has a step name, step type description and progressed at, column which populates with a date when the workflow step is progressed.
3. The column with the heading "M" signifies the milestone steps, allowing the case manager to ensure that milestone steps are progressed. Milestone steps are also published to the client case progression portal in upcoming updates.
