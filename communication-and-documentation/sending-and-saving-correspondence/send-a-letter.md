Using the buttons the letter can be saved to the history, edited or cancelled.
Attachments can also be added to the letter from the document items in the history of the case.

1. **Save** - The letter will be saved to the history without any editing, but the letter item will be available for editing for up to 48 hours after this time the letter will be locked.
   After this time when the letter is locked it cannot be edited, the letter can be generated from the template again and edited, printed and saved to the history.
2. **Attachments** - This button will open an attachments window and will show a list of the history items, documents and letters.
   The list can be searched by entering the search criteria or text and clicking the search icon and double clicking on a document will display the document in the preview panel.
   The checkbox at the side of the items list will mark the item to be added to the letter as an attachment.
